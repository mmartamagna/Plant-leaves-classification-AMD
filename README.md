### *Marta Magnani (961071) - Università degli Studi di Milano*

Project for the module **Algoritms for Massive Data** of the course Algoritms for Massive Data, Cloud and Distributed Computing for the academic year 2022-2023. The task is to implement a deep-learning-based system classifying pictures of leaves according to the twelve types of plants using the «Plant leaves» dataset. The «Plant leaves» dataset is published on Kaggle and released under the Community Data License Agreement – Sharing, Version 1.0.
