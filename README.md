### About the project
Project for the module **Algoritms for Massive Data** of the course Algoritms for Massive Data, Cloud and Distributed Computing for the academic year 2022-2023. The task is to implement a deep-learning-based system classifying pictures of leaves according to the twelve types of plants using the «Plant leaves» dataset. The «Plant leaves» dataset is published on Kaggle and released under the Community Data License Agreement – Sharing, Version 1.0. Here the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/plant-leaves-for-image-classification.

### Implemented CNNs models
- Binary classification (healthy-diseased)
- Multiclass classification (12 species)
- Multiclass classification (22 complete names)

### Built With
* Python 3.10.11
* Tensorflow version: 2.9.2
* OpenCV
